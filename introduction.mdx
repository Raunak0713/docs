## What is Sendify?

Sendify is your no-BS, plug-and-play notification system for NextJS and ReactJS applications. It lets you send, store, and display real-time notifications like an absolute pro using **Socket.IO** and **Convex**. No headaches, just notifications.

## Key Features
- ðŸ“¡ **Real-time notifications** because nobody likes waiting.
- ðŸ“¦ **Ridiculously easy integration** with ReactJS/NextJS.
- ðŸ“Š **Scalable storage** powered by Convex, so your database doesnâ€™t cry.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable UI** because default styling is for quitters.
- ðŸš€ **Blazing fast performance** because slow apps are embarrassing.
