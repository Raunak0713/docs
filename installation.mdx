### **Step 1: Install Sendify**  
Pop this bad boy into your terminal and let the magic happen:  

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i sendify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### **Step 2: Generate Your API Keys**  
You‚Äôll need some keys to unlock the Sendify kingdom üîë. Grab yours here : [Generate Keys](https://sendify.100xbuild.com/dashboard/projects)  

### **Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and toss in your shiny new keys: (yes, right there) 

```env
SENDIFY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENDIFY_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
```

### **Step 4**: Create an Instance of Sendify
Create a `lib` folder and depending on your sanity level add a `sendify.js` or `sendify.ts` file inside. If you're the TypeScript type (the overachiever), here's how you do it:

<CodeGroup>


```ts TS
// lib/sendify.ts (because you like pain, I mean, Type Safety)

import { Sendify } from "sendify";

const sendify = new Sendify(
  process.env.SENDIFY_API_KEY as string,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENDIFY_PROJECT_ID as string
);

export { sendify };
```

```js JS
// lib/sendify.js

import { Sendify } from "sendify";

const sendify = new Sendify(
  process.env.SENDIFY_API_KEY,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENDIFY_PROJECT_ID
);

export { sendify };
```

</CodeGroup>

üéâ **Wow, look at you!** You actually set up Sendify. Gold star! ‚≠ê Or not‚ÄîI'm not here to validate your life choices. Now go spam some notifications like the absolute legend you are.
