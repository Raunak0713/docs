## Sending Notifications (Because Thatâ€™s the Whole Point, Right?)

Oh, so you actually want to **send** notifications? Wow, what a revolutionary concept. Luckily for you, itâ€™s so easy even a goldfish with Wi-Fi could do it. Letâ€™s break it down.

## Before You Start: API Keys & Unique User IDs Matter!

First things firstâ€”do you have your **API keys** set up? No? Then what are you doing here? Notifications donâ€™t send themselves. Check the [Installation Guide](/installation) before wasting any more of your precious time.

Next, letâ€™s talk **user IDs**. And I cannot stress this enoughâ€”**they must be unique**. If you think using "user1" for every single person is a genius idea, congratulations, you just created the world's worst notification system. Use an email, a UUID, or literally anything that **distinguishes one user from another**. A random string? Sure, as long as itâ€™s actually unique per user.

## Server (a.k.a. The Brains Behind It All)

```ts
import { sendify } from "sendify";

// Imagine this is inside an API route where an auction is created

await sendify.sendNotifications(
  ["user123", "user456"], // Array of user IDs to notify (you know, unique ones)
  "A new auction just went live!", // Notification content (make it interesting, maybe?)
  "Check it out", // Button text (optional, but who doesnâ€™t like buttons?)
  "https://yourapp.com/auctions/123" // Button URL (optional, unless you want users to guess where to go)
);
```

## Client (a.k.a. Where Users See The Magic)

<CodeGroup>
```tsx TSX
import { NotificationFeed } from "sendify";

const UserNotifications = ({ userId }: { userId: string }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <NotificationFeed userId={userId} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserNotifications;
```

```jsx JSX
import { NotificationFeed } from "sendify";

const UserNotifications = ({ userId }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <NotificationFeed userId={userId} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserNotifications;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Breakdown of `sendify.sendNotifications()` (Because Details Matter, Apparently)

1. **First argument (`userIds`)** â€“ Whoâ€™s getting the notification? This must be an array. One user? `["user123"]`. Multiple users? `["user1", "user2"]`. **Make sure these are unique! I will not repeat this again. Maybe on the next page. Who knows?**
2. **Second argument (`content`)** â€“ The actual message. Keep it short and sweet. Nobody wants to read a novel in their notifications.
3. **Third argument (`buttonText` - optional)** â€“ If you want a button, this is the text. If not, then just pretend this argument doesnâ€™t exist.
4. **Fourth argument (`buttonUrl` - optional)** â€“ Where does the button take users? Your app? A cat video? Itâ€™s up to you.

## Thatâ€™s It.

You now know how to send notifications like a pro. No unnecessary bloat, no overcomplicated nonsenseâ€”just clean, real-time notifications. Now go forth and notify the world. ðŸš€ (Or donâ€™t. Iâ€™m not your boss.)
