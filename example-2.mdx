## Example 2: Different Tech, Same Smooth Notifications

Oh, you didnâ€™t like Prisma? Fine. Hereâ€™s another example where we throw in a completely different tech stack to prove Sendify plays nice with everything.

Letâ€™s say weâ€™re running an event platform, and we want to notify users when a new event is live. This time, weâ€™re using MongoDB and Express, because why not?

## Server (a.k.a. Your Backend of Choice)

```ts
// server/createEvent.ts
import { sendify } from "sendify";
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URI);
const db = client.db("eventDB");

env.SENDIFY_API_KEY || throw new Error("Missing SENDIFY_API_KEY. This isn't optional, you know.");

const createEvent = async (title: string, category: string) => {
  await client.connect();

  // Store event in MongoDB
  const event = await db.collection("events").insertOne({ title, category });

  // Fetch users who like this category
  const interestedUsers = await db.collection("users").find({ interests: category }).toArray();

  const userIds = interestedUsers.map(user => user.email);
  
  if (!userIds.length) {
    console.log("No interested users found. Guess no one cares about this event.");
    return;
  }

  await sendify.sendNotifications(
    userIds, // Notify only relevant users
    `New event: ${title}!`, // Content
    "Join now", // Button text (optional, but why not?)
    `https://yourapp.com/events/${event.insertedId}` // Dynamic event link
  );
};
```

## Client (a.k.a. Frontend Doing Its Job)

```tsx
// components/UserNotifications.tsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "sendify";

const UserNotifications = ({ userId }: { userId: string }) => {
  if (!userId) {
    throw new Error("Missing userId. You sure you know who your users are?");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <NotificationFeed userId={userId} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserNotifications;
```

## Whatâ€™s Different Here?

1. **We used MongoDB instead of Prisma** â€“ Because variety is the spice of life.
2. **Express instead of some Next.js API route** â€“ Just to mix things up.
3. **Same Sendify integration** â€“ Because it just works. No matter what backend, database, or questionable tech choices you make.

## Final Words

So yeah, Sendify doesnâ€™t care what you use. As long as your code runs and your users have actual unique IDs, notifications will work flawlessly. ðŸš€
