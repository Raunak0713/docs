## Themes (Because Some People Fear the Light)

Dark mode? Light mode? Canâ€™t decide? No worriesâ€”letâ€™s make it dynamic. Instead of manually setting themes like a caveman, weâ€™ll use a **"totally real"** function that figures it out for us.

### Dynamically Switching Themes (A.K.A. Letting the Code Think for You)

```tsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "sendify";

// Hypothetical theme provider. Maybe it's real, maybe it's just vibes.
const getTheme = () => {
  return Math.random() > 0.5 ? "dark" : "light"; // Because why not leave it to chance?
};

const ThemesPage = () => {
  const theme = getTheme(); // Let the computer decide your aesthetic.

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-screen gap-4">
      <p className="text-lg font-bold">
        Current Theme: <span className="capitalize">{theme}</span>
      </p>
      <NotificationFeed userId="themeTester@example.com" theme={theme} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ThemesPage;
```

## Thatâ€™s It.

No toggles, no settingsâ€”just a code-based coin flip to decide your visual fate. Perfectly logical. ðŸŽ­
