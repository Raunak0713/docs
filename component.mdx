## The Essentials

Alright, listen up. Sendify is all about making real-time notifications stupidly simple. To achieve that, we give you **one** main component: `NotificationFeed`. Thatâ€™s it. No fluff, no nonsense.

## `NotificationFeed`

This bad boy does all the heavy lifting. It fetches notifications, listens for real-time updates, and makes you look like a genius.

## How to Use It

### First, do you even have your API keys set up?

If not, what are you even doing here? Go back and actually follow the [installation guide](https://docs.sendify.100xbuild.com/installation). Iâ€™ll wait. (But seriously, you need them for this to work, genius.)

### Now, letâ€™s use `NotificationFeed` like a pro.

```tsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "sendify";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <NotificationFeed userId="unique-user-id" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

### About `userId` (a.k.a. The Most Important Thing Here)

Listen up, because this is crucial. The `userId` **MUST BE UNIQUE** per user. That means:

- An **email**? Sure.
- A **database ID**? Perfect.
- A completely random string you pulled out of thin air? Sure, as long as it's actually unique per user. Don't make it weird.
- The same `userId` for all users? Absolutely not. Donâ€™t do that. Ever.

If you mess this up, your users will start seeing each otherâ€™s notifications. Unless youâ€™re building a chaotic social experiment, thatâ€™s probably **not** what you want.

## Thatâ€™s It.

You now know how to use Sendifyâ€™s one and only component. No unnecessary bloat, no overcomplicated nonsenseâ€”just clean, real-time notifications. Now go forth and notify the world. ðŸš€
